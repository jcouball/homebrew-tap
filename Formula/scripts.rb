    # The 'jcouball/scripts' repository places all executable scripts directly in the
    # 'bin' directory. This command will install all files from the 'bin' directory
    # of the downloaded tarball into Homebrew's bin directory, making them available
    # in the PATH.

    # for a quick test.

    # You could also try to run a command if it has a simple, non-destructive output,
    # like a --version or --help flag.
